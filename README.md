# Marketr MGMT #

### What is it? ###

Marketr MGMT is a project management app for marketing and the process of creating assets. Users can create projects, assign them to campaigns, assign users to the projects, and give the project a timeline for deliverables. On the project, users can upload the files and then comment on the assets, provide feedback, and create multiple revisions to the assets. 

There is also a notification center that will display all of the recent activity on projects they are working on. 

### How is it made? ###

This application is made using React and Redux on the frontend and the backend in Ruby on Rails. The frontend is styled with a mixture of th Semantic UI CSS library along with custom CSS styling. The frontend also utilizes some librarys like Draft.js that is used to create a wysiwyg editor. The backend utializes the gem Paperclip that helps manage files that are uploaded and is linked with Amazon's S3 to store files.
